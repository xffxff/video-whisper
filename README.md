# Video2Doc

Video2Doc is a tool designed to convert videos into comprehensive documents, incorporating both images and text. This facilitates the efficient extraction of information from videos, particularly useful for lengthy content.

Check out [this demo](./examples/how_cuda_works_gtc2021) showcasing the conversion of a 40-minute video [How GPU Computing Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l10o0DYJXg).

The tool leverages traditional scene detection, Whisper, and a multimodal model for video understanding. We utilize [Aria](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Aria) as the multimodal model to enhance the accuracy and depth of the analysis.
